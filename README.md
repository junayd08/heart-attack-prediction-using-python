# heart-attack-prediction-using-python
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart attack risk in Indonesia using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors, the model helps identify individuals at high risk.

Key Features:
âœ… Data preprocessing and feature engineering
âœ… Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for key insights
âœ… Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
âœ… Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics
âœ… Interactive visualizations with Power BI

This project contributes to public health efforts by leveraging data-driven insights to enhance early detection and prevention of heart disease.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Results:
The Random Forest model achieved 73.08% accuracy in predicting heart attack risk in Indonesia. While effective, it struggles with recall, misclassifying some high-risk cases. Improvements like better feature selection, data balancing, and advanced models can enhance accuracy. Deploying an interactive dashboard will help in real-world healthcare applications.
