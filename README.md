# heart-attack-prediction-using-python
This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart attack risk in Indonesia using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors, the model helps identify individuals at high risk.

Key Features:
âœ… Data preprocessing and feature engineering
âœ… Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for key insights
âœ… Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
âœ… Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics
âœ… Interactive visualizations with Power BI

This project contributes to public health efforts by leveraging data-driven insights to enhance early detection and prevention of heart disease.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Power BI
